** Brief code instructions
- load_data.R (do not print any object from this script in the console)
- spde.osc.temporal is the main script for manipulating data and
  fiting models M0, M1 and M2. Models M0 and M1 may be fit
  "reasonably" fast on a standard computer. Model M2 is
  computationally intensive.
- predictions_M0.M1.M2.R contains code for plotting fitted intensity functions for models M0, M1 and M2

** An illustrative example
Firstly, we load the raw data (session id =M14_2018-05-16_11-29-05=, gridness score 0.913)
#+begin_src R :results output code :exports code :session *R:grid_fields*  :tangle yes
  load(url("https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~ipapasta/mouse_data.RData"))
  ls()
#+end_src
