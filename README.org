* Repository for R code associated with manuscript on statistical analysis of spike trains from grid cells using Poisson points process models
** Brief code instructions
- load_data.R (do not print any object from this script in the console)
- spde.osc.temporal is the main script for manipulating data and
  fiting models M0, M1 and M2. Models M0 and M1 may be fit
  "reasonably" fast on a standard computer. Model M2 is
  computationally intensive.
- predictions_M0.M1.M2.R contains code for plotting fitted intensity functions for models M0, M1 and M2
